First a warning. 

You need to understand what this software does and how it works. This software is deliberately 
set up to not work out of the box. You are potentially handing out the keys to all your
infrastructure. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 

How the software works. 

Client opens a telnet connection to port ktservice on the KDC

Server(listenkeytab) spits back IP address and closes connection. 

Listenkeytab then passes IP address to unix domain socket. 

Instkeytab runs in background and reads ip addrs from unix domain socket.
It checks them for validity ( resolve to host in domain and any other checks).
Instkeytab calls extkeytab to extract keytab. Instkeytab then uses a special
ssh keypair to cat the keytab to root on the client. 

Root on the client has an entry like this in it's authorized hosts file. 

from="your.kdc.host.com",command="/opt/sbin/catchkeytab" ssh-dss <SPECIAL SSH PUBLIC KEY> catchkeytab
